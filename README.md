 WaterWiZ is a one-stop center of information for easy-access water statistics.

 Our website collects and stores data on 22 water systems and treatment plants, covering 4 water suppliers in the greater Philadelphia region. 
 Using our map page, you can find the closest water system that serves your community. Our water suppliers webpage has a list of all the suppliers and the areas they serve organized by counties and water systems.

 Our site allows us to easily plug-in data so we can keep it running with up-to-date water data. We hope to directly work with each water supplier to provide real-time updates about water quality information. We also hope to make this a nation-wide website that can automatically trigger notifications to every house hold in a certain area when there is an issue with water quality.
